# What is Pig game?
The Pig Game is called so because the game's scoring system is based on the concept of a piggy bank. In the game, players accumulate points by rolling the dice, and they can choose to "bank" their points at any time, just like depositing money into a piggy bank. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their accumulated points for that turn, just like breaking open a piggy bank to find it empty. The game's name is a reference to this concept of saving and losing points, similar to saving and breaking open a piggy bank.
